The design for our final MusicEditor remains similar to our structure from
the previous assignment. To accommodate the changes we did make a few changes.
 We split our main class's methods to be part of our MusicController class. We
 also modified our Midi view to utilize a timer rather than Thread.sleep so
 that it could be used in conjunction with our Gui view in our composite view
 . In our ConcreteGuiViewPanel we added a GraphicsUpdater class so that it
 could load the notes of our song more efficiently, which proved essential
 for getting our composite view running at a decent speed.

 Other than that our design proved to be effective at handling these new
 tasks. We added a keyboard handler, a mouse handler and a mouse runnable
 class for mouse and keyboard inputs, and used our controller to add the
 correct functions. In our gui view we also added functions for removing and
 adding notes so that they could be assigned to inputs by the controller.

 Commands for the gui view:
 Arrow keys - move the scrollbars
 Home / FN + Left - move to beginning of the song
 End/ FN + Right - move to the end of the song
 Left Click - removes the note you clicked on, starting at the beat where you
 clicked
 A - begins a dialogue for adding a note

 Commands for composite view:
 P - Pauses/Resumes playback
